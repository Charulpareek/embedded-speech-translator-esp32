# Embedded Multilingual Speech Translation System using ESP32

A low-cost embedded speech translation system that captures spoken English using an ESP32 device and converts it into translated speech in Hindi or Telugu using speech recognition, translation, and text-to-speech synthesis.

The project demonstrates how **embedded devices can interact with AI services to build a speech-to-speech translation pipeline.**

## 📚 Project Overview

This project implements a multilingual speech translation system using an **ESP32 microcontroller** and AI-based speech processing tools.

The system captures spoken input from a microphone, converts speech to text using **Vosk speech recognition**, translates the recognized text, and generates translated speech that is played through a speaker connected to the ESP32.

### Supported Languages
- English → Hindi
- English → Telugu

### Key Concepts
- Embedded Systems
- Speech Recognition
- Natural Language Processing
- Edge + Server AI Architecture
- IoT Communication

Speech recognition runs using Vosk, while translation and speech synthesis are handled by server-side services.

## ⚙️ Workflow

1. User speaks English into the **INMP441 microphone** connected to the ESP32.
2. The ESP32 records audio using the **I2S interface**.
3. The recorded audio is sent to a **speech recognition server**.
4. Speech is converted into text using **Vosk STT**.
5. The text is translated into **Hindi or Telugu**.
6. A text-to-speech system generates translated audio.
7. The ESP32 downloads the generated audio and plays it through the **speaker**.

## 📊 Performance Metrics

Typical execution timing:

| Stage | Approx Time |
|------|-------------|
Audio Recording | ~3 seconds |
Speech Recognition | ~30-35 seconds |
Translation + TTS | ~2 seconds |
Audio Playback | ~2 seconds |

Total pipeline time: **~40 seconds**

The prototype prioritizes demonstrating the complete speech translation pipeline.  
Future improvements will focus on **latency reduction and edge processing**.
